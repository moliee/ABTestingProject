# ABTestingProject
This project is offered as part of Udacity's AB Testing course (presented by Google). It focuses on design and analysis of A/B tests. The course covers how to choose and characterize metrics to evaluate your experiments, how to design an experiment with enough statistical power and how to analyze the results and draw valid conclusions.
